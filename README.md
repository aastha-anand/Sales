This project demonstrates how to create a comprehensive Sales Dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard is designed to provide a detailed analysis of sales data, enabling users to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), track trends, and make informed business decisions.

Key Features:
a) Data Import & Processing: Imported data from multiple sources, cleaned 
   and processed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
b) Advanced Visualizations: Utilized Power BI’s advanced charts, graphs, 
   and maps to present sales performance and insights.
c) Interactive Filters & Slicers: Incorporated filters and slicers to 
   allow users to interact with the data and customize the view based on 
   time periods, product categories, regions, etc.
d) Forecasting: Applied Power BI’s forecasting capabilities to predict 
   future sales trends.
e) Export Options: Enabled export of the dashboard as a PDF for easy 
   sharing and reporting.

Insights & Learnings:
a) Gained hands-on experience in data manipulation and visualization 
   techniques.
b) Mastered the use of Power BI’s powerful features like DAX (Data 
   Analysis Expressions), interactive dashboards, and forecasting.
c) Enhanced business intelligence skills by designing a dashboard that 
   can be used for strategic decision-making.
